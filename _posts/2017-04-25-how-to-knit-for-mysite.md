Thanks largely to [this awesome blog post](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), it took me less than an hour to set up a local [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site on my machine and familiarize myself with the structure. Next, I started pulling and modifying files from the [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme until I had the basic look I wanted (a minimalist black-and-white theme with a permanent sidebar and blog). I added some basic content (About Me, publications, etc), and by nightfall I was happy enough with my new site to go live on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Not bad for a day's work. 

But the smooth sailing ended the next day when I started trying to incorporate R Markdown documents with R code and graphical output. I read several blog posts on using R Markdown and `knitr` to create pages for your jekyll/GitHub site (e.g., [here](https://rgriff23.github.io/) and [here](https://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html)). The basic idea is this: 

1. Write your page in an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document, including chunks of R code
2. Use [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/) to "knit" the `*.Rmd` file, which produces a simple [Markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) `*.md` file and output files, including any figures produced by your R code
3. Add the `*.md` file and output to the GitHub repository for your site
4. Sit back and relax as GitHub pages automatically builds and serves your site, rendering your `*.md` and dependent files into an attractive `*.html` page with syntax highlighting for your code and R output displayed.

I added my first `*.Rmd`->`*.md` page with R figures (my silly [`cards`](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/caRds) page). I then built and previewed my site locally on my machine, and when I saw that everything was beautiful, I pushed it to GitHub. But when I went to view the live site, I was horrified to see that all of the R figures were missing! How could this be?

I checked the `html` source code for the page and discovered the immediate problem: the file paths to the figures had an extra forward slash appended to the beginning of the path, e.g., `<img src="//project/figure/fig.png" />` rather than `<img src="/project/figure/fig.png" />`. Apparently the offending slash was being added when my `*.md` files were rendered into `*.html` by GitHub/jekyll. 

I am not going to attempt to figure out what sorcery caused this extra slash to appear in my `html`- I'm sure there is a good reason why GitHub/jekyll behave this way. What I AM going to do is explain what exactly I did that seemed to cause the problem, and how I fixed it with a few lines of R code.  

### The problem

Locally, my website lives in the directory `/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/`. After creating my `caRds.Rmd` file, I added it to my website's `projects` folder, and then ran `knit` like so:


```r
# load knitr
library(knitr)

# navigate to directory of caRds.Rmd
setwd("/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/projects/")

# knit
knit("caRds.Rmd")
```

As expected, `knit` produced the file `caRds.md` in my `projects` directory, as well as a new folder called `figure` which was filled with all the figures produced by my R code. Opening the Markdown file reveals that `caRds.md` points to each figure with a relative path like this:

```
![figure1](figure/figure1.png)
```

I had no problem previewing the the Markdown file in R Studio, nor did I have a problem building the site locally on my machine. The issue only occurred when I pushed the site to GitHub. The `html` generated by GitHub/jekyll seemingly wanted the image paths to be absolute, and also fixed an extra slash to the beginning of each absolute path: `<img src="//projects/figure/figure1.png" />`. After a bit of tinkering, I discovered that if I manually edited the Markdown file to include the absolute paths from my site root, like this:

```
![figure1](/projects/figure/figure1.png)
```

Then GitHub/jekyll would leave my paths alone and produce proper `html` tags linking to my figures. I suppose I could do that manually for all my Markdown files every time I knit, but the whole point of blogging with R Markdown/knitr/jekyll/GitHub is supposed to be the convenient workflow, and having to edit all the figure paths in my Markdown files after knitting them is not my idea of convenience. I reasoned that there were two general approaches to solving this problem:

1. Make some adjustment to the knitting process so that the resulting `*.md` files include the absolute path to the figures on my site
2. Make some adjustment to the jekyll configuration so that GitHub/jekyll don't mess up my paths

I ended up going with the first approach, mostly because I am more comfortable with R/knitr than I am messing with `jekyll` settings. I should note that because my approach changes the paths in the `*.md` files such that they are no longer relative, you will no longer be able to preview them in R Studio- you will get an error telling you that your document points to files that don't exist. I don't love it, but it isn't a big deal to me because I rarely feel the need to preview the intermediate `*.md` files.

### The solution

The key is to recognize that the figure paths produced by `knit` are a combination of two parameters, `base.url` + `fig.path`, which can be modified with the functions `opts_knit` and `opts_chunk` respectively. The defaults are `base.url = NULL` and `fig.path = "figure/"`, such that the default figure path ends up being simply `figure/`. Importantly, since `fig.path` is a chunk option, changing it will not just change the paths in the resulting `*.md` file; it will also change where your figures are actually sent when you run `knit`. Specifically, your figures will be sent to `base.dir` + `fig.path` (note that `base.dir` and `base.url` are different!). Wow, that's a bit confusing! Let's distill this down:

> `knit` SENDS your figures to `base.dir` + `fig.path`, and the resulting Markdown POINTS to figures in `base.url` + `fig.path`. 

When I run `knit` for my `*.Rmd` files, what I want is for the figures to be SENT the correct directory on my machine, so I want `base.dir` + `fig.path` to define an absolute path on my machine:

`/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/projects/figure/`

However, in order for the paths to be specified correctly when GitHub/jekyll build my site, I want the resulting `*.md` file to point towards figures with an absolute path from the root of my website:

`/projects/figure/`

Here is how this can work in R:


```r
# define paths
base.dir <- "/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/"
base.url <- "/"
fig.path <- "projects/figure/"

# this is where figures will be sent
paste0(base.dir, fig.path)
```

```
## [1] "/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/projects/figure/"
```

```r
# this is where markdown will point for figures
paste0(base.url, fig.path)
```

```
## [1] "/projects/figure/"
```

Okay, that looks like what I want! Now, set the parameters using `opts_knit` and `opts_chunk`.


```r
# set knitr parameters
opts_knit$set(base.dir = base.dir, base.url = base.url)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path) 
```

And finally, navigate to the `project` directory containing `caRds.Rmd` and run `knit` (this ensures that `knit` sends `caRds.md` to the same directory as `caRds.Rmd`, which is what I want)


```r
# change directory
setwd("/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/projects/")

# knit
knit("caRds.Rmd") 
```

And that does the trick! The resulting Markdown file now points towards figures with absolute paths from my site root, e.g., `/project/figure/figure1.png`, and GitHub/jekyll produce an `html` page that displays the figures properly.

I cleaned this up by setting the `knit` options within the `*.Rmd` file itself. I added the following lines of code to an R chunk placed right after the front matter in `caRds.Rmd`:

```
knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = "/Users/nunnlab/Desktop/GitHub/rgriff23.github.io/", base.url = "/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "projects/figure/")
```

Now I can just navigate to the `project` directory and run `knit` without setting any options outside of the `*.Rmd` file. Assuming I want the figures for all of my 'projects' to be stored in `/projects/figure/`, I can use the same `knitr` settings for all of my project `*.Rmd`'s.
