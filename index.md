  I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at
  <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a> , <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a>. I am fortunately to be supervised by
  <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a> studying <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn/olden/Index.htm"> mathematics</a>.
  
  <p> I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning and Bayesian methods. My Ph.D. research focuses on the statistical dpendencies between latent variables, random samples, multiple tasks, etc. Some of my interests are: </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Approximate Bayes inference, eg. VB, MCMC, SMC, EP, EM; </li>
  <li> Causal inference </li>
  <li> Statistical learning theory </li>
  <li> Information theory </li>
  <li> Bayesian deep learning </li>
   <li> Biomedical and healthcare </li>
  </ul>
