 I am from Kunming, a beautiful city in southwest China. I got my PhD from the <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a> at
  <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. I was fortunately to be advised by
  <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate in the <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn/olden/Index.htm"> School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a>. </p>
   
  <p> I will join the <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu">Data Science Institute </a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University </a> as a post-doctoral fellow, mentored by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/">Prof. David Blei </a> and <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu/department-directory/name/simon-tavare/">Prof. Simon Tavar√©</a>.</p>
  
 <p> I am broadly interested in Bayesian statistics and machine learning.  My thesis has focused on the variational methods with dependence structures, by designing fast and accurate algorithms, and analyzing their theoretical properties. My research interests are: </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
   <li> Approximate Bayesian inference </li>
   <li> Causal inference </li>
   <li> Information theory, asymptotics </li>
   <li> Meta-learning and domain adaptation</li>
   <li> Biomedical research</li>
  </ul>
