  I am a Ph.D. student at
  <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a>. I am fortunately to be advised by
  <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a> studying <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn/olden/Index.htm"> mathematics</a>.
  
  <p> I am broadly interested in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. My Ph.D. research focuses on the statistical dependence structures at different levels of data. My research interests are: </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
   <li> (Approximate) Bayesian inference </li>
   <li> Causal inference </li>
   <li> Information theory, asymptotics </li>
   <li> Meta-learning and domain adaptation</li>
   <li> Biomedical research</li>
  </ul>
