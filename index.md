   <p> Welcome to my homepage! </p>
   
 <p> I am an assistant professor of <a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/marketing-department/">Marketing</a> at the Warrington College of Business of the University of Florida. </p>
 
<p>  Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu">Data Science Institute</a> and <a href="https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu">IICD</a>, Columbia University, mentored by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/">Prof. David M. Blei</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Tavaré">Prof. Simon Tavaré</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a> where I was supervised by <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate at the  School of Mathematical Sciences, <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a>, Shanghai. </p>

 
<p> My research focuses on the intersection of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, causal inference, and marketing research. The topics I am interested in include </p>

  <ul>
   <li> <ins>Probabilistic machine learning</ins>: deep generative model, meta-learning, conformal inference, asymptotics</li>
   <li> <ins>Bayesian inference and modeling</ins>: variational inference, uncertainty estimation, discrete model, variable selection </li>
   <li> <ins>Causal inference</ins>: heterogeneous treatment effects, sensitivity analysis, quasi-experimental design </li>
   <li> <ins>Marketing research</ins>: customer analytics, online advertising, text data analysis </li>
  </ul>
