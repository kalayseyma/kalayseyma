  I am an upcoming 4-th year Ph.D. student at
  <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a> , <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a>
  where I am advised by
  <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>. Before coming to UT, I received B.S. in mathematics at <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a>.
  I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning and Bayesian methods. Some of my interests are 
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Approximate Bayes inference, esp. variational inference and MCMC; </li>
  <li> Bayesian deep learning; </li>
  <li> Generative models; </li>
  <li> Topic models; </li>
  <li> Convex/Non-convex optimization </li>
  </ul>
