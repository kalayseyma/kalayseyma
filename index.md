   <p> Welcome to my homepage! </p>
   
 <p> I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu">Data Science Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/">Prof. David M. Blei</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Tavaré">Prof. Simon Tavaré</a>.</p>
 
I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Statistics </a> from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a> where I was supervised by <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate at the <a href="https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm"> School of Mathematical Sciences</a> in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a>, Shanghai. </p>
 
In fall 2022, I will join the University of Florida, Warrington College of Business, <a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/marketing-department/">Marketing department </a> as an assistant professor

<p> 
I am working in the areas of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and causal inference.  <a                                                                                           href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/83980/YIN-DISSERTATION-2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">My thesis </a> focuses on the variational methods with dependence structures. The topics I am interested in include </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
   <li> <ins>Causal inference and machine learning</ins>: heterogeneous treatment effects, sensitivity analysis, quasi-experimental design </li>
   <li> <ins>Bayesian inference and modeling</ins>: variational inference, uncertainty estimation, discrete model, meta-learning, asymptotics </li>
   <li> <ins>Marketing research</ins>: customer analytics, online advertising, text data analysis
  </ul>
