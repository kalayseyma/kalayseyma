Here is a quote from my favorite mathematician that inspires me:

"Every science, once it is treated not as an instrument for gaining dominion and power, but as part of the adventure of knowledge of our species through the ages, may be nothing but that harmony, more or less rich, more or less grand depending on the times, which unfolds over generations and centuries through the delicate counterpoint of each of its themes as they appear one by one, as if summoned forth from the void to join up and intermingle with each other."

— Récoltes et Semailles, Grothendieck

Besides reading scientific papers, I like reading literatures by Rabindranath Tagore, Hermann Hesse and many Taiwanese writers.
