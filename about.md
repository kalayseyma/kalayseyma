*Status*

I am in my final year of a PhD program in <a target="_blank" href="https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/graduate">evolutionary anthropology at Duke</a>, where I research the ecology and evolution of primates (and sometimes other things). I spend most of my time at an R Console. 

*Side notes*

These are my pets, Mr. Spock and Mr. Cody:
